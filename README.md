## üîß MCP Services Integration

The launcher connects to multiple MCP services, each providing specialized tools. **Any Node.js-based MCP service can be added** through the dashboard configuration - simply provide the npm package name, startup command, and optional configuration parameters.

| Service | Tools | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Memory** | 9 tools | Knowledge graph, entity storage, relationship mapping |
| **Filesystem** | 12 tools | File operations, directory management, secure access |
| **Git** | 25 tools | Repository management, commit operations, branch handling |
| **Fetch** | 4 tools | Web scraping, HTTP requests, content retrieval |
| **Playwright** | 28 tools | Browser automation, screenshot capture, web testing |
| **Database** | 1 tool | MySQL database queries and operations |

### Example MCP Usage URLs

For use with Claude.ai or other MCP clients:

```
# Main MCP endpoint (SSE)
https://your-domain.com/sse

# Health monitoring
https://your-domain.com/health

# Service status

```

---

## üìã Requirements

- **Docker & Docker Compose:** For container deployment
- **Redis:** For session storage (included in docker-compose)
- **Reverse Proxy (Recommended):** Nginx or Traefik for HTTPS termination

3. **Test MCP Connection:**
   ```bash
   # Test health endpoint
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   
   # Test MCP SSE endpoint
   curl -H "Accept: text/event-stream" http://localhost:3000/sse
   ```

    options: []
    install: "npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
    
  - name: filesystem  
    startup_command: npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
    options: ["/workspace"]
    
  - name: your-custom-service
    startup_command: npx your-awesome-mcp-package

## üîå MCP Proxy Architecture

### How It Works

1. **Service Discovery:** Launcher spawns child processes for each configured MCP service
2. **Tool Registration:** Each service's tools are discovered via `tools/list` JSON-RPC calls  
3. **Unified Toolbox Creation:** All tools from all services are consolidated into a single toolbox for MCP clients
4. **Dynamic Routing:** Tools are prefixed with service names (`memory_read`, `git_status`, etc.) and routed intelligently
5. **Request Handling:** Client requests are parsed and routed to appropriate services
6. **Response Streaming:** Results are streamed back via Server-Sent Events (SSE)

**The key advantage:** MCP clients see all your configured services as one unified toolbox, making it seamless to use tools from different services in a single conversation or workflow.

### Protocol Support

- **JSON-RPC 2.0:** Standard MCP protocol communication
- **Server-Sent Events:** Real-time streaming for client connections
- **HTTP REST:** Health monitoring and service management endpoints
- **WebSocket:** Future support planned for enhanced real-time communication

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### With Claude.ai

1. Configure Claude to use your MCP endpoint:
   ```
   MCP Server URL: https://your-domain.com/sse
   ```

2. Available tools will include all tools from all configured services in one unified toolbox:
   - `memory_store` - Store information in knowledge graph
   - `filesystem_read` - Read files from configured directories  
   - `git_status` - Check repository status
   - `fetch_get` - Retrieve web content
   - `playwright_screenshot` - Capture webpage screenshots
   - `dbhub_query` - Execute database queries
   - `your_custom_service_tool` - Any tools from custom MCP services you've added

**Pro tip:** Claude will see all these tools as one cohesive toolbox, allowing seamless workflows like "read a file, process it with a custom tool, store results in memory, and commit changes to git" - all in one conversation!

### Direct API Usage

```bash
# Get available tools
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'

# Call a specific tool
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":2,
    "method":"tools/call",
    "params":{
      "name":"memory_store",
      "arguments":{"content":"Important information to remember"}
    }
  }'
```

## üìä Monitoring & Debugging

### Health Monitoring

```bash
# Overall system health
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Individual service status
curl http://localhost:3000/services

# Restart specific service
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/restart/memory
```

### Log Analysis

The application provides comprehensive logging:

- **HTTP Traffic:** All incoming requests and responses
- **MCP Communication:** JSON-RPC messages between services  
- **Service Management:** Startup, shutdown, and error events
- **Performance Metrics:** Response times and tool usage statistics

Access logs via:
```bash
# Application logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Service-specific logs  
docker-compose exec app tail -f /tmp/server.log
```

## üîê Security Considerations

- **OAuth2 Security:** Full PKCE support, secure token handling
- **Filesystem Isolation:** Configurable allowed directories for filesystem service
- **Session Security:** Redis-backed sessions with configurable timeouts
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive parameter validation for all tools
- **CORS Protection:** Configurable allowed origins and methods
