## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Getting started with MCP Launcher is simple. The included `docker-compose.yml` file handles the setup of the main application and its Redis dependency.

**1. Build and Run the Container:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This command will build the `mcp-launcher` image and start the necessary containers in the background.

**2. Access the Dashboard:**

Once the container is running, you can access the configuration dashboard at:

*   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
*   **Default Username:** `admin@email.com`
*   **Default Password:** `mcp-admin`

**3. Initial Configuration:**

Upon your first login, you will be prompted to configure the necessary settings for your environment. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for managing the various configuration files used by MCP Launcher and its integrated services.

## üîß Configuration

MCP Launcher's configuration is managed through a set of YAML files, which can be edited directly or through the web dashboard.

### User Management

Users for the dashboard are managed in the `app/config/dashboard.yaml` file. You can add new users and manage existing ones by editing this file. Passwords are automatically hashed when updated through the dashboard.

### Scopes and Password Changes

*   **OAuth2 Scopes:** The available OAuth2 scopes are defined in `app/config/local.yaml`. You can customize these to fit the needs of your applications.
*   **Password Changes:** User passwords for the dashboard can be changed by logging in and using the provided form. The application will handle the necessary hashing and update the configuration file.

### API and OAuth2 Endpoints

MCP Launcher exposes several important endpoints for authentication and API documentation:

*   **API Documentation:** `http://localhost:3000/docs`
*   **OAuth2 Authorization Endpoint:** `/oauth/oauth2/auth`
*   **OAuth2 Token Endpoint:** `/oauth/oauth2/token`
*   **OpenID Connect Discovery:** `/.well-known/openid-configuration`

For a full list of endpoints and their usage, please refer to the API documentation available at the `/docs` endpoint.
